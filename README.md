# Life in Weeks
My Version

Read more about [Life in Weeks at Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).

This code was copied and adapted from [Gina Trapani](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/) who copied [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks). It is a single webpage statically-rendered with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) hosted on Netlify. It consists of two [data](data/events.yml) [files](data/colors.yml), [an introduction](content/index.md), and a [template](layouts/_default/index.html).

## 🚀 Setup

   ```sh
   brew install hugo  # Mac

The font is [Red Hat Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display). Colors chosen via [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). Edited in [Zed](https://zed.dev).
